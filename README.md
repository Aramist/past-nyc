## Overview
### Description
This app will use your GPS location and show you how the area you're in looked like in the early 1900s. 

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Education
- **Mobile:** This app would most likely be mobile.
- **Story:** Analyzes location data and retrieves the closest image from the early 1900s taken nearest to your location. (e.g if you're standing on Astor Pl. you'll see the crossroad of Lafayette St. and Astor Pl. or Broadway and 8th St.)
- **Market:** Anyone will be able to use this app. No groupings neccesary
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often as one would like. It would mostly be used for educational purpose.
- **Scope:** First we can use this app to engage people with the history of NYC. This could evolve to other cities where different version of this app could exist like "PAST Paris" or "PAST London".
